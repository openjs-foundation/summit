# Node.js Collaborator Summit

The Node.js Foundation hosts regular summits for active contributors to the node.js project, this repository is being used to organize them.

## Cost
Free!

Although the summits may be coordinated with other events/conferences, you do not need to pay/attend those events to participate in a summit. We also have travel funds for individual members of the Node.js foundation (e.g. Node.js core collaborators) to cover their travel expenses. See [the documentation on travel funds](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md) for details.
