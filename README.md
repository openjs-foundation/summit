# Collaboration Summits of OpenJS Foundation projects

Some projects under the OpenJS Foundation host regular summits for contributors and community members. This repository is being used to organize them.

The collaboration summits tend to be unconferences, either in-person or hybrid, where contributors and community members share knowledge about the project and the ecosystem, brainstorm solutions to technical and non-technical issues, make progress in decision-making discussions, and push forward new initiatives.
