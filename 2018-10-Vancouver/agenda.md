## Organizers

- Dan Shaw @dshaw
- Manil Chowdhurian @chowdhurian
- Matteo Collina @mcollina
- Tracy Lee @ladyleet

## Attendance

Anyone can come, but we will not be explicitly onboarding at Collab 
Summit Vancouver. Conversations can move fast as working groups have 
a lot of context. Unlike the Spring instance of the Collab Summit, this Fall instance includes a morning of Code + Learn. The Code + Learn session guides people through contributing to the project, prior to congregating for the Summit.

Working groups will put together a brief schedule so that people can 
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator 
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

Atteneeds must register at: https://www.regonline.com/?eventID=2152653&rTypeID=511098
Access code: COLLABSUMMITONLY

## Working groups in attendance

We'd love to know ahead who will be represented. Filing issues in this repo is helpful for discussion particular to a working group and how they'd like to manage their time. Linking to that here would be great! We're working on creating a Projects Board to post times for this on the conf agenda so people are aware of when a WG meets and can maybe get a break, if needed. We'll be looking at issues filed in this repo titled "Berlin: working group something something" to add these below as well.  
- Working group that will be at Collaboration Summit
  - Name of contact @github-handle
  - link to working group planning issue
  - Any extra requests(space during conf, av/sound, etc.)
  
## Travel Fund
There are funds available for any Individual Member of the Node.js Foundation to receive travel funds to Collab Summit.  Membership is free for active collaborators. Sign up [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/members#members).

PLEASE follow the instructions for application to receive travel funds [HERE](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md#process).

  
------------------------


We should figure out what topics we want to cover. 
We think we will be best served with some monotrack presentations and discussions in the first day, and then breakout rooms in the second day. __We can change everything__, so if you think a better structure will suit us better, let us know! 
It would be fantastic if each one of the breakouts is facilitated by someone who will be responsible to "run" the breakout and do a quick presentation at the end. This person would also set some outcomes from the breakout so we leverage our time together in the best possible ways.
